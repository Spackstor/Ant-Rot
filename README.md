# Ant-Rot
Attic Antenna Rotator

Far from broadcasters,  I have a number of yagi antenna to consistantly bring in a number of signals. In the summer months however, because the heat stratifies the troposphere, bonus channels are fleetingly available from many directions. A rotating antenna is handy for those.

The end result of this project is a browser based GUI that allows the rotation of an attic antenna. This is accomplished using electronics and a programmed ESP8266-12e in conjunction with a DIY light weight bowtie antenna and a number of printed 3D parts.

Wiring diagram also makes required components obvious. All components were aquired off ebay.
