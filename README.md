# Antenna Rotator - ESP8266-12e

This is just annother ESP project, nothing special. 

Far from broadcasters,  I have a number of yagi antenna to consistantly bring in a number of signals. In the summer months however, because the heat stratifies the troposphere, bonus channels are fleetingly available from many directions. A rotating antenna is handy for those.

The end result of this project is a browser based GUI that allows the rotation of an attic antenna. This is accomplished using electronics and a programmed ESP8266-12e in conjunction with a DIY light weight bowtie antenna and a number of printed 3D parts.

Wiring diagram also makes required components obvious. All components were aquired off ebay.

The STLfiles.7z is a zip file containing the rotator parts which can be printed. The STL files are in millimeters. Output from my cad often puts these to inches so they may have to be rescaled. The contained .sldprt are exported solid works parts.
